Cache
    -L1(fast), L2, L3(slower)

Mapping Function
    -Determines which cache location the memory block will occupy.
    -Uses the "Least recently used" algrorithm,
    
Operating System
    -A program that controlls the execution of application programs
    -An interface between applications and hardware
    
    -Programs broken down from:
        -API (Read This File)
        -ABI (Instructions)
        -ISA
        
    -Evolve over time
        -Hardware upgrades

-skim the problems

-memory hierarchy
    -(hit ration * cache acess) + (1 - hit ratio) * (main memory acess)
    
-cache is transparent to the os

-operating system main goals
    -managing resources
    -protection
    -accessing hardware
    
-four things an instruttion can do
    -read
    -write
    -?
    -?
    
-Dont worry to much about specific operating systems

-three ways to do memory i/o
    -processor i/o
    -interrupts
    -direct memory access
    
    -advantages
    -disadvantages
    
-trap is a reaction to an error

-what is a semaphore? what are its two operations?
    -allows ou to control critical errors and mutual exclusion
        -best if done atomically
                
-critical area/region
    -a portion of memory or resource that can only be accessed by one process at a time
    
-Processes have access to things. threads do not.
